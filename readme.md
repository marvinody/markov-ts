# Markovs in Typescript

## WIP, so bare with me
to build, use `npm run watch`
to run, `node dist/bundle.js --help`

## Using provided state.json
Simply run `node dist/bundle.js say state.json`
The corpus for this markov chain can be found in small_corpus.txt

The bot doesn't really handle punctuation and start of sentences well yet.
It also ends everything with `END OF LINE`


END OF LINE
